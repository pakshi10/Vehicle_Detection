# Overview
An AI tool to help authorities to ensure vehicle have safe distance in real time by using computer vision and Deep Learning Algorithms on various Video Surveillance sources, Developed upon YOLO V4 & PYQT 5

# Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize your knowledge. The idea of this project struck to me when I was learning deep learning and our mentor to apply our knowledge to make end to end project with GUI on our project. I couldn't find any relevant videos associated with it. And that led me to work on  deep learning model using this amazing tool.

# Technical Aspect 
This project is divided into two part:
  Using a deep learning model to identify Vehicle.
  Building GUI using PyQt5.
  
 
## Installation:
* Fork the repository and download the code.
* Download the following files and place it in the Yolo directory
